### Why Git?

#### The Problem

When working on a project, you may want to

- go back to a previous state (e.g. what did this project look like last week)
- undo a change
- track who made which change when
- work with one or more colleagues (without trampling over each other's work)
- try an experiment; maybe keep it, maybe not

#### A Solution?

Suppose you are writing a term paper. You have various drafts where you've tried various arguments, you've sent out copies to classmates for proof-reading, etc. 

How do you manage all these versions?

You could save lots of copies with _clever_ names

    `MyTermPaper.docx`, 
    `MyTermPaper-version2.docx`, 
    `MyTermPaper-latest.docx`, 
    `MyTermPaper-TuesdayAt3pm.docx`,
    `MyTermPaper-latest2.docx`
    ...

and email copies to various friends for proof-reading

    `MyTermPaper-forMary.docx`, 
    `MyTermPaper-forTakeshi.docx`, 
    `MyTermPaper-forMomAndDad.docx`, 

Now which version did copy when I sent it to Takeshi? Latest? Latest2? And how do I incorporate his changes?
