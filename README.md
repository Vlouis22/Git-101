### Git 101


# https://github.com/profburke/git101

This repository contains the slides and exercises for the Git 101 workshop presented as part of the January 2022 Software Engineering Summit.

Git is a large and very complex tool, however, you don't need to learn every aspect of it to get started.

This workshop focusses on the minimum necessary for you to use Git in the Hackathon. As such, we do not cover a lot of git commands and for those that we do, some of what I said might not be 100% accurate--I'm aiming for _understandable in an hour_ and _gets the job done for now_.
