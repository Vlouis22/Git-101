### Further Resources

Here are some good references on Git

- An [episode of Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92sycL8ij-U) with a great overview of Git

- [Git Kraken Learn](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn), and in particular [this article](https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/git-vs-github) is worth a read.

- Run into a problem? Try [Dangit Git](https://dangitgit.com/en)

- The [Atlassian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git)

- [Git snippets](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/git/p/1)

- [Understanding Git Conceptually](https://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/)

The last one is really important if you want to progress beyond the "memorize a bunch of recipes" stage of using Git.
