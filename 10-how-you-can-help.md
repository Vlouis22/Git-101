### Pay it Forward

Some or all of this may be covered on your daily surveys, 
but as you use git during the hackathon, think about the following: 

- was this workshop too long? not long enough?
- what did I forget to tell you?
- what wasn't explained well?
- other suggestions/constructive criticisms?


Please send me answers to the above either through the Slack help channel, tagged with :git: or as a DM to @matthew.burke

Your responses will help shape this workshop for future Summits!
